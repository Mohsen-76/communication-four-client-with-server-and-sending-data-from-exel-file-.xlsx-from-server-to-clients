hi this is a network project 
first you have to run server.py
and then entry ip and port then server will be bind.

then you have to run client.py in diffrent operating system
beacuse ip of each client have to be diffrent
for example you have to run a client.py file in windows and onother 
client.py file have to run on linux and any OS.
